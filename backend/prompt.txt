Evaluate the hand-drawn floor plan using the following rubric:

1. Sketch – A clear house floor plan with labeled rooms (25 pts)  
2. Description – Two sentences describing the sketch (25 pts)  
3. Dimensions – Room dimensions present (25 pts)  
4. Scale – Imperial or metric scale indicator (10 pts)  
5. Compass – North arrow or compass rose (10 pts)  
6. Differences – One sentence explaining how this differs from a professional plan (5 pts)

Full points are awarded if the item is present and clear; partial points for minor issues; zero if missing.

=== PROMPT ===
You are an expert architecture grader. Evaluate the attached hand-drawn floor plan according to the rubric above.
Scores should reflect the AI judgment: full points if requirement met, partial if partially met, zero if not included.
In making the judgement, don't be too strict (be generous, just looking for more serious failures); 100% is very possible.
Be sure that the rubric items really exist before awarding any points. If there are no descriptive sentences, don't award the description at all, etc.
Provide a short textual explanation in "feedback" (2–4 sentences).

Return **only** valid JSON with this exact structure (no markdown fences, no extra text):
