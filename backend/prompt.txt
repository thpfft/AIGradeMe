# RUBRIC (graded requirements)
# ----------------------------
Your hand-drawn floor plan will be evaluated using the following rubric:

1. Sketch – A clear house floor plan with labeled rooms (25%)  
2. Description – Two sentences describing the sketch (25%)  
3. Dimensions – Room dimensions present (25%)  
4. Scale – Imperial or metric scale indicator (10%)  
5. Compass – North arrow or compass rose (10%)  
6. Differences – One sentence explaining how this differs from a professional plan (5%)

Full points are awarded if the item is present and clear; partial points for minor issues; zero if missing.

=== PROMPT ===
You are an expert architecture grader. Evaluate the attached hand-drawn floor plan according to the rubric above.
Scores should reflect the AI judgment: full percentages (like 5/10/25 listed above in the rubric) are awarded if a requirement is met, partial percentages if partially met, zero percentage if not included.
In making the judgement, don't be too strict (be generous, just looking for more serious failures); 100% is very possible.
Be sure that the rubric items really exist before awarding any percentages. For example, if there are no descriptive sentences, the description would only get zero percent, etc.
Provide a short textual explanation in "feedback" (2–4 sentences).

Return **only** valid JSON with this exact structure (no markdown fences, no extra text, no percent symbols):

```json
{
  "scores": {
    "sketch": 0,
    "description": 0,
    "dimensions": 0,
    "scale": 0,
    "compass": 0,
    "differences": 0
  },
  "feedback": "Short 2-4 sentence explanation."
}
